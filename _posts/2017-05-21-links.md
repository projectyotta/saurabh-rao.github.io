##  Google being boss LVL 
So google actually performed an SHA-1 collision ! Quoting from the post as such , "Today, more than 20 years after of SHA-1 was first introduced, we are announcing the first practical technique for generating a collision. " What really blows my mind is the amount of computational resources that went into actually making sure that they could generate a collision. Â  A few numbers about that : 

  * Nine quintillion (9,223,372,036,854,775,808) SHA1 computations in total
  * 6,500 years of CPU computation to complete the attack first phase
  * 110 years of GPU computation to complete the second phase![](https://maruwahna.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/a02d4-complexity2bcompared.png)I still remember going through the MD5 method back in collegeÂ , and thinking to myself , what is the degree of improvements that current methods have over the MD5 . I encountered the SHA1 then and remember thinking that it was a pretty solid fix. That being said , it is important to keep in mind that cryptography is always a cat and mouse game . The harder people try to protect their data and privacy with world class standards, the other side will try equally harder , if not more , to come up with methods to crack said standards. And that , I think , is the beauty of it . A constant struggle to beat the odds.

##  The David vs Goliath of E commerce in India. Only, Goliath wins.

We all love a David vs Goliath story, where the little guy wins. I think we've been fed this myth that the small guy always wins. You know, by popular opinion, family and movies. It's good to see an example of something that I think is the case that should occur more often...where Goliath wins, simply because of sheer power and influence. I'm not a fan of everything that Amazon does. But one thing that I have always respected about them is their attention to customer problems. Good to know that is paying off :)  <a href="http://m.economictimes.com/small-biz/startups/battle-with-amazon-costs-flipkart-internet-rs-2306-crore-last-fiscal/articleshow/55657977.cms"> Link to full article </a>

## A really interesting application which could reduce opioid usage

I've really been fascinated with how opioid usage has almost reached epidemic proportions in the last decade. It's interesting to see how technology seems to address addiction. It'd be really awesome to measure how the rate of addiction is decreasing among users though!Â  <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/2017/01/05/fighting-opioid-addiction-with-new-tech-devices-to-treat-chronic-pain.html"> Link to full article </a> 

## How do you decide how well respected brands are ?

Their methodology mainly involves asking respondents to mention a company they think satisfies their constraints and one that does not and repeating the process in an iterative fashion.Â  That being said , it's interesting to think that just because a brand is respected , it might result in more sales . I find that claim to be slightly dubious . I mean , sure , I hate burger king , I hate the process through which year food is put through , I hate the fact that their cashiers always look like they hate their job . But still , I would still consider burger king only because it is cheap .Â  Another example : I hate governments in most countries , and I am sure a lot of other people do too, but that does not stop me from understanding the fact that the government serves a very useful purpose .Â  The Brands That Make Customers Feel Respected <a href="https://hbr.org/2016/11/the-brands-that-make-customers-feel-respected"> Link to full article</a> 

## Tumblr launches live video support in partnership with YouTube, YouNow and others

So Tumblr introduces live video options. I wonder if their api would support downloading the live cast. There's a huge market for that. Especially when you look at websites which can almost come up as niche ones which publish only those videos. And, another thing is that websites like 4chan dig this kind of thing. There have been news articles about live suicides on Tumblr which go extremely popular on 4chan. It'll be interesting to see how this feature changes their interaction with their userbase. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/06/21/tumblr-launches-live-video-support-in-partnership-with-youtube-younow-and-others/"> Link to full article </a>

## Microsoft is trying to be cool kid on the block. And they're doing a good job at it.Â 

Microsoft has added a Pokemon Detector to OneDrive, which automatically detects + puts them in a photo album for you. While this might not be huge news or even worth covering, I believe this is a step in the right direction for them. They've changed of late, investing in software catering to the Marijuana industry in the USA. Who would have thought that Microsoft, a company whose founder was BFFs with Warren Buffet, an icon of the traditional risk free conventional investor type who shaped much of the industry, could go in this different a direction.Â  Heck, wasn't Microsoft always the bumbling uncle on the block who used to release V 1.0 with a ton of bugs, capture all the market share and then release V 2.0 and above ? What happened to that Microsoft? Is this because of a change in their approach to business or is it just something they seem to be doing on the side? They have diversified of late, and have taken huge steps to not be seen as the bad boy of the tech world (the anti trust lawsuit the US government destroyed a part of his life with #NeverForget Â :p). They've become a responsible kid now, a far cry from the company's teenage days, where Gates ruled with an iron fist.Â It's almost like a seismic change in their approach to business. How much of it will actually benefit them, remains to be seen.Â     <a href="https://blogs.office.com/2016/07/22/automatic-albums-improved-search-pokemon-and-more-updates-to-the-onedrive-photos-experience/"> Link to full article </a> 

## Snapchat adoption among brands

The article begins with a strong start. He does show some data which illustrates the fact that snapchat is being used by a lot of people and brands are slow in adoption. There's a main reason for this -Â  snapchat needs content to be created daily. Something which the industry as a whole hasn't woken up to yet. What's missing from the article? The actual content : how do brands engage snapchat audiences while it doesn't cost a bomb and needs a ton of effort? <a href="http://tech.co/brand-snapchat-not-hard-2016-06"> Link to full article </a>

# Tesla is Done Being an Automaker. It's Now an Energy Company. How viable is this?

I've always been slightly skeptical of Elon Musk. Don't get me wrong, I appreciate and respect his engineering abilities. He's probably one of the smartest CEOs alive today. The issue i have is with the direction in which the business is going. He says he is building a long term system, something which can sustain and run over time . But at the same time, it's important to understand the fact that as a business, it's important to start generating actual sales revenues to sustain in the longer run. And that aspect has not been great for tesla. They've tried to better things, like increasing production capacity at their factories, but they've been producing relatively smaller outputs when compared to how advancedÂ  the industrial age is these days. It'd be interesting to see how tesla tackles this issue. It's crucial to consider the fact that a company cannot keep jumping onto new products / strategies to keep the funding active. ( Musk's idea to buy solar city, I think, is a move to increase stock prices. Good move, but I don't think it's worth the effort and is being given too much credence) . Elon, I believe , at the end of the day, is a true scientist and idealist at heart. While that might be great for the kind of products and ideas that it has, it might not necessarily translate into good business acumen. I also love the fact that tesla is also looking at the global market for sales and not limiting itself to just traditionally first world counties. The fact that they are launching the product at the same time throughout the world speaks volumes on their effort to truly be seen as a global company. <a href="https://www.wired.com/2016/06/tesla-solar-city-elon-musk/?mbid=social_fb"> Link to full article </a>

 ## A hypothetical Indian e-commerce space collaborationÂ 

Â  It's an interesting piece on what would hypothetically happen if a lot of the Indian e commerce biggies joined forces to take on amazon.Â  I'd still chose amazon.

## Just noticed that Uber increased the minimum paytm balance amount from INR 200 to 500

Apart from the tweet mentioned below, there are a few more interactions from the Uber India twitter handle which can more than confirm this. Wonder why they jacked up the minimum balance to 500. Is it because they're looking for more people to use cash? I mean, if it is cash only that you're looking at, then why bother giving the people the option to pay with paytm? Take a look at @Uber_India's Tweet: https://twitter.com/Uber_India/status/747790753364049920?s=09
