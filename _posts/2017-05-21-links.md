## 2017-02-25 : Google being boss LVL 
So google actually performed an SHA-1 collision ! Quoting from the post as such , "Today, more than 20 years after of SHA-1 was first introduced, we are announcing the first practical technique for generating a collision. " What really blows my mind is the amount of computational resources that went into actually making sure that they could generate a collision. Â  A few numbers about that : 

  * Nine quintillion (9,223,372,036,854,775,808) SHA1 computations in total
  * 6,500 years of CPU computation to complete the attack first phase
  * 110 years of GPU computation to complete the second phase![](https://maruwahna.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/a02d4-complexity2bcompared.png)I still remember going through the MD5 method back in collegeÂ , and thinking to myself , what is the degree of improvements that current methods have over the MD5 . I encountered the SHA1 then and remember thinking that it was a pretty solid fix. That being said , it is important to keep in mind that cryptography is always a cat and mouse game . The harder people try to protect their data and privacy with world class standards, the other side will try equally harder , if not more , to come up with methods to crack said standards. And that , I think , is the beauty of it . A constant struggle to beat the odds.

## 2016-11-28 The David vs Goliath of E commerce in India. Only, Goliath wins.

We all love a David vs Goliath story, where the little guy wins. I think we've been fed this myth that the small guy always wins. You know, by popular opinion, family and movies. It's good to see an example of something that I think is the case that should occur more often...where Goliath wins, simply because of sheer power and influence. I'm not a fan of everything that Amazon does. But one thing that I have always respected about them is their attention to customer problems. Good to know that is paying off :)  <a href="http://m.economictimes.com/small-biz/startups/battle-with-amazon-costs-flipkart-internet-rs-2306-crore-last-fiscal/articleshow/55657977.cms"> Link to full article </a>

## 2017-01-05 A really interesting application which could reduce opioid usage

I've really been fascinated with how opioid usage has almost reached epidemic proportions in the last decade. It's interesting to see how technology seems to address addiction. It'd be really awesome to measure how the rate of addiction is decreasing among users though!Â  <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/2017/01/05/fighting-opioid-addiction-with-new-tech-devices-to-treat-chronic-pain.html"> Link to full article </a> 

## 2016-11-02 How do you decide how well respected brands are ?

Their methodology mainly involves asking respondents to mention a company they think satisfies their constraints and one that does not and repeating the process in an iterative fashion.Â  That being said , it's interesting to think that just because a brand is respected , it might result in more sales . I find that claim to be slightly dubious . I mean , sure , I hate burger king , I hate the process through which year food is put through , I hate the fact that their cashiers always look like they hate their job . But still , I would still consider burger king only because it is cheap .Â  Another example : I hate governments in most countries , and I am sure a lot of other people do too, but that does not stop me from understanding the fact that the government serves a very useful purpose .Â  The Brands That Make Customers Feel Respected <a href="https://hbr.org/2016/11/the-brands-that-make-customers-feel-respected"> Link to full article</a> 

## 2016-06-22 Tumblr launches live video support in partnership with YouTube, YouNow and others

So Tumblr introduces live video options. I wonder if their api would support downloading the live cast. There's a huge market for that. Especially when you look at websites which can almost come up as niche ones which publish only those videos. And, another thing is that websites like 4chan dig this kind of thing. There have been news articles about live suicides on Tumblr which go extremely popular on 4chan. It'll be interesting to see how this feature changes their interaction with their userbase. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/06/21/tumblr-launches-live-video-support-in-partnership-with-youtube-younow-and-others/"> Link to full article </a>
