## 2017-02-25 : Google being boss LVL 
So google actually performed an SHA-1 collision ! Quoting from the post as such , "Today, more than 20 years after of SHA-1 was first introduced, we are announcing the first practical technique for generating a collision. " What really blows my mind is the amount of computational resources that went into actually making sure that they could generate a collision. Â  A few numbers about that : 

  * Nine quintillion (9,223,372,036,854,775,808) SHA1 computations in total
  * 6,500 years of CPU computation to complete the attack first phase
  * 110 years of GPU computation to complete the second phase![](https://maruwahna.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/a02d4-complexity2bcompared.png)I still remember going through the MD5 method back in collegeÂ , and thinking to myself , what is the degree of improvements that current methods have over the MD5 . I encountered the SHA1 then and remember thinking that it was a pretty solid fix. That being said , it is important to keep in mind that cryptography is always a cat and mouse game . The harder people try to protect their data and privacy with world class standards, the other side will try equally harder , if not more , to come up with methods to crack said standards. And that , I think , is the beauty of it . A constant struggle to beat the odds.

## 2016-11-28 The David vs Goliath of E commerce in India. Only, Goliath wins.

We all love a David vs Goliath story, where the little guy wins. I think we've been fed this myth that the small guy always wins. You know, by popular opinion, family and movies. It's good to see an example of something that I think is the case that should occur more often...where Goliath wins, simply because of sheer power and influence. I'm not a fan of everything that Amazon does. But one thing that I have always respected about them is their attention to customer problems. Good to know that is paying off :)  <a href="http://m.economictimes.com/small-biz/startups/battle-with-amazon-costs-flipkart-internet-rs-2306-crore-last-fiscal/articleshow/55657977.cms"> Link to full article </a>
