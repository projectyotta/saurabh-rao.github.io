## Light(en) up 

A light slap to the pocket , frantic looks hither and a desperation that would put a hungry child to shame . Ah , there it is , the three and a half inches of craving that she so desperately seeks . A cheap flame producer is summoned from the depths of her jeans and the cylinder is lit at its end , precariously perched on her lips .

The first drag , light , almost coaxing the craving to give her a high . Now , well lit and half an inch later , a deep inhalation , almost to the point of breathlessness. And then , almost magically , the smoke comes out , bellowing fire like the dragon of lore . Weightless , emotionless , thoughtless- all things she would love to be . These two minutes of solitude with her nicotine buddy give her hope of just that .

As the translucent vapors rise and say hello to the sky , she wonders what it would be like to fly away . Fly away , far away from all the madness and pain , the guilt and the tears . A drop of salty liquid makes its way down her chiseled jaw , almost mocking her of the soup she was in . But the nicotine buzz convinces her that it was a dust particle in her eye that is to be blamed for the tear . A desperate cry for togetherness or loneliness , she is too screwed up to figure that out . A few more lonely puffs later , she stubs it out . Three inches of doom they are , she knows this all too well . But at the moment , the least of her concerns .

With a firm touch of her long fingers , she wipes the sadness away . Swept under the rug as if it were to be discarded . Makes a promise that she knows she will eventually break , to stay away from things that caused her to face the deluge of emotional torrents . One final glance at her time strap , and she notices she has overstayed . Quickly hurries down , to pretend to be a part of perfection again . Then , silence . Darkness . A sad , almost sarcastic chuckle . Perfection , it seems .

## Mera beta Engineer banega 

The month of May, a time of happiness for the entire tenth student community. The boards are done with, good riddance! N ever will I again have to learn that boring stuff, is what most of them will say. The late night television, the midnight happy birthday phone calls and texts and the farewells, both official and unofficial account for the general boisterous mood. You get home, and for the first few days, your folks don’t mind whatever you do. Supernatural marathons, sleepovers, a lunch with your best friends, all granted. But a fortnight later, the concerned tone begins. Like those business proposal growth charts, the voice just keeps getting higher and higher in pitch, volume and frustration. “Study raa, these next two years are crucial for your career”. Career, all of six letters, but this word will haunt you, right from the pre intermediate days to the post PG days.

At that age, at least I was clueless of what career meant (I still am, but let’s forget that for a moment). Life revolved more around that cute girl you had a crush on and the pirated versions of new video games. And so the increasingly high pitched voices continued. It was pretty much the same with me. Added to the usual boring tones was that sense of pride , all because some distant relative’s kid had managed to clear IIT , and my folks’ logic went that ,” if he can , why can’t ours ?. “.“Look at him raa, such dedication and hard work he put in for two whole years”, said my mom, conveniently ignoring the fact that I had never even met the said cousin. After I refused to even acknowledge her statement, she left away in a huff, commenting “useless this kid is , nowhere he will in life.” I had a sarcastic retort in mind , but chose not to tell it out , because I believe in not hurting the other person(joking , if I did so , I would probably end up in a hospital’s ICU).I instead philosophically chose to reflect upon the incident as a gentle reminder of my general laziness.

But on the fourth day of my self-proclaimed “do absolutely nothing” time , the rude doorbell suddenly interrupted my afternoon siesta . Still groggy and hair not having seen a comb for the past week, I opened the door . Two semi-bald uncles were there, giving me toothpaste smiles like those airhead actresses on the idiot box. “Good afternoon, we are from something something college, can we come in?” I graciously welcomed them as they did not look like the usual salesmen who always asked me if I wanted to buy their overpriced, yet discounted goods. I was an innocent tenth pass fellow , not knowing what I was committing myself to – two years of one boring life . Inside, they showed the folks lots of ranks that their students got in lots of exams. “IIT first rank open category last three years we only got madam”. My parents were suitably impressed, it showed on their faces. I, on the other hand, was more concerned about the photo shopped images that stood next to a huge, animated “1”. Parents told them that they were suitably impressed with the (made up) statistics the college had to offer, and that they would get back to them. Little did they know how corporate intermediate education works. For the next ten days, the same old toothpaste uncles came home. “Please sir, put in our college. Your child will be taught by excellent faculty.”

It was like a mosquito that troubles you for the entire night after you leave the window open. At last, both parties agreed to put me in something something college. Toothpaste uncles even got a contract, I think, making it seem like they were sealing a shadowy deal or something. I wanted to yell “nahinn!” like those melodramatic, heavy makeup heroines on star plus, but instead, I chose to express my unhappiness by not having food (PS: not having food is a very bad idea, please don’t try it at home). So a few weeks later, I joined the college.

Phase one: Complete

__________________________________________________________________

First day. I must admit there was a certain amount of coolness with the fact that we could now wear color dresses. I sat in the last bench that day, unable to understand what to expect. Enter the dragon, in comes in a middle aged guy who instantly reminded me of the villain from cheap mythological shows. Compared to him, toothpaste uncles seemed like angels. Paan stained teeth, smell of cigarettes and a nonexistent smile, all topped up with a belly that would put any sumo wrestler to shame. He told us that he would be teaching chemistry. He proceeded with atomic structure that day. After one and half excruciating hours, the only chemistry that I understood, courtesy of my neighbor, is that the amount of food you eat is directly proportional to the amount of adipose your body accumulates.

So my intermediate life began. The hours were longs and the conditions were grim (yes, I’m still referring to the college, not the situation during a war). Never mind the fact that a very small fraction of what I did In college could actually be considered as productive , but still , staying in that godforsaken place was a punishment in itself . I mean, the sense of witty sarcastic retorts that I was so famous for was lost. Also, my sense of imagination and curiosity. To give you a small example of the imagination bit , there were a few bits of tangled electric wires that I used to see every day while coming back home. Before my something something days , I used to stare at those wires and wonder and presume all sorts of situations , but now , all I wonder is that how in the world is Kirchhoff’s law applicable to so many wires at one go .

One of my most favorite teacher in something something college was the math sir. Not because I understood anything about conditional probability or Simpson’s rule, but purely due to the comic relief he provided. “There is a lack of lagging in a portion is there raa, you dirty boys”, he used to say frequently. After a hurried conference interspersed with giggles in the lunch break , we fellow drones figured out it was pointless to dwell on statements of higher meaning like those . As far as the weekly exams went, just pretend and lie to yourself that you understood everything, and then mark symmetric patterns in the response sheet for the multiple choice questions. Earlier,I was somewhat of a voracious reader and a pretty decent poet (even though I say the “pretty good” part myself). Russian writers like Gogol and Tolstoy, the idealism of Marx and the sheer brutality of Attila the Hun used to fascinate me. I used to have an opinion on everything ranging from the side effects of excessive Prozac usage to the ever present metal music scene in Finland. But after joining something something college, the closest I have come to poetry is asking the above mentioned math sir “what saar, answer I am not getting only. You told the question correctly aa?”

Almost two years passed by in the same manner. I almost got slapped by a physics sir once because I didn’t know what the coefficient of apparent expansion of quartz glass was (I still don’t, but let’s not bother about that).The only thing that made life bearable was the humor and smiles that the fellow drones provided. We cracked jokes on everything ranging from the chemistry sir’s accent to the changing political landscape. We copied (ONLY when the invigilator was out of the class) in examinations in college , and sometimes ended up getting caught with micro chits, which was , usually , followed by a slap or a warning to tell our parents that we would get nowhere in life. We laughed it all away, with a resilience that fascinates me even today.

Phase two: complete

___________________________________________________

Now, as the results of IIT, AIEEE and other posh exams are out, I’m none too ashamed to say that I didn’t crack them. However, being the smart guy that I am (even though I say so myself), I did end up cracking a few other entrances and now, life isn’t that bad. After shocking revelations in the second year that we will NOT be allowed to copy or carry chits in the main examinations, some of the other drones began to study , and a few of the highly industrious ones have even cracked the most draconian entrance exam ever known to man . So , as I leave two years of intermediate education , a few words of advice for the juniors who will go through the drudgery (If chief guests at school functions can speak a few words , then so can I ). Yes, these two years aren’t exactly a fairytale.

Yes, you will have to study most of the time and forget that you even had a social life. The creativity that you possessed will have to be on the backburner. Even though you will hate it, you will have to force yourself to love pulleys and redox reactions and the general equation of a circle. I don’t regret joining something something college (joking, of course I do). But still , these guys forced me to sit at one place for long hours and force fed me chemical equations , and even though I didn’t make it to the crème de la crème of the educational institutions , I did manage to sneak into an engineering college. But if you truly hate engineering, convince your folks, reason with them. I on the other hand, was more of a “don’t know where to go, so join engineering” types. My heart didn’t lie in pursuing engineering after tenth, but my entire clan reasoned with me and told me that engineering had many options to pursue four years later. And though the upsurge in hormones in those days made it difficult to accept their decision, now, I see the truth and I am slowly coming to terms with it.

Yes, creativity and innovation will take a backseat for these two years, but I look forward with optimism to the next four, where, hopefully, my grey cells will flourish. People say Intermediate colleges are hell, that those two years of their life, they would love to think of it as but a bad memory. And I am inclined to agree with them, yes the going isn’t easy. But these guys teach you survival, how to cope with failure and how to laugh it away with a smile even when the situation is bleak. Those things matter.

## Seven words 

So I have this habit of asking people to tell me seven words. Seven random words, they don’t need to have any correlation at all. Just seven random words , not connected to form a sentence . Then , using those seven words as a base , i try to make up a short story . (Okay , I admit , sometimes the stupidity acts up and I type gibberish , but usually , I  try my best to make sense).

A friend of mine gave me my first seven words, and this is my first story on those .

========

sleep , depression , morning , eight , communism , glasses , life .

========

“Yes mumma , I’ll brush my teeth after the glass of milk . Yes mumma , I added chawanprash to the milk .”

“Take care beti . I know you’re alone in the big city, stay safe,stay strong.Love you”

“Yes mumma , love you too. You have a good night’s sleep , and for goodness sake , turn up the heater , I know how cold it gets in Dehra in November”.

Anisha sighed . This breakup business was taking a heavy toll on her . She no longer liked to apply kohl on her child like eyes , instead laying in bed all day , watching nat geo with those kohl smeared pools of black . On the plus side though , she knew she was getting extremely good at lying to mumma .  The rationalist lawyer in her knew this . That was the best part of a voice call , the person on the other end couldn’t guess her true emotions…read the small yet significant changes in her facial expressions .

The mother couldn’t make out if she was in tears , those kohl smeared puffy eyes darting throughout the two bedroom condo . Or notice her cutting her hand at two AM to numb the pain that wasn’t exactly physical . Or her petite hands , accustomed to making his favorite grilled cheese sandwich with a steaming cup of black coffee . Those hands now didn’t do any of that , just facepalmed really hard , for being that trustworthy . She wondered , what had Ruthwik taught her after all? Making sandwiched after the movie was done at 2 AM ? And then , the ironical smile followed by  the snigger .

Groggy at seven in the morning , staring at the pile of novels glistening in the semi darkness. On any other day , she would be grinning , her perfect teeth showing partially.She would lie in his arms , reading  Tolstoy  and the ideals of communism.Simpler times those were.He would alternate between stroking her one strand of floppy hair that refused to be tucked under her ear and ranting about how unfair the referee was during the EPL encounter.She would pretend to understand, and croon soothing phrases in her husky tone . He would simmer down and smile . All that , a distant memory .

As the sun said hello to her , she picked up the well bound War and Peace . As she read page number thirty four , she smiled , again . 

## Kavya , you're really nice :) 

Six thirty in the morning . The digitized strains of Yaariyaan were resounding in her ears . As Amit Chauhan’s voice said hello to her joined earlobes , she woke up , rubbing her eyes . The blue green irises she inherited from her mother darted around her shared accomodation , looking for any signs of familiarity . The hostel mates she had for company were company only in namesake , making sure she felt as hostile as possible . She woke up fully now , and went to the kitchen to make herself a cupaa joe .

As she waited for the ancient heater to heat the diluted milk concoction with the instant coffee mixture , she wonder how she’s be dressing today . Would it be the green salwar kameez with the little chikan endings that she found incredibly nice , or the levis jeans she had purchased a few months ago , after delibrating if a pair of branded tight leggings was worth an entire two and a half grand of Mahatma Gandhi printed paper . “I wonder how the jeans would look with the white tee “ , she thought to herself . “Ah well , white and blue with a bit of chunky metal never went wrong on any occasion “ , she reasoned .

The coffee now heated to a steaming crescendo , she took it out and poured it out into a mug , without sugar . “Shakkar khaogee to moti ho jaaogi beti “ , her mother used to say . A half smile creeped up her perfect lips , almost jokingly . As if the weight influenced her nature of work . Ha! , analyzing stock patterns for Russian businessmen . Those Russian Mafioso were all about the money , straight down to business , no pleasentaries even . But recently , the opportunities on the grey region of the moralistic black and white spectrum weren’t interesting enough . So a little side venture had begun .

She’d feel neglected , as though she was used up like a rag doll, her flower penetrated for selfish purposes and left aside to dry out in the cold North winds. That wasn’t true in the technical sense though . She’d been getting letters of appreciation , soap boxes , chocolate hampers , spa coupons and mac makeup kits by the box loads ….the works . But the satisfaction of a six foot blonde Nordic man thousands of miles away from her didn’t do much to satisfy her appetite . She wanted something a lot more …..personal .

Since the day she could solve question papers , her conservative parents had made sure she aced every test she ever wrote .  And she was happy doing so , thinking their satisfaction was all that mattered anyways in life . “Kavya , why did you get only 87 in this pareeksha beti? what happened ? why are you losing concentration again ? Do you want me to give you more almonds in the morning ? “ . And there was the abuse , the constant , continued abuse , right until she ran off to college , away from home . Dad was someone she idolized , no doubt , but his savage beatings used to scare her no end . One bad test result , or him getting to know one guy liked her , and she was as useful as cancer cells in her fragile brain . I don’t know , maybe seeing others appreciate her was her way of seeing this from a rose colored lens . Maybe there was a better world after all , where she wasn’t judged at every turning of her life , and her achievements were…validated . Maybe the world was a better place after all , even though this was the optimist in her talking . Daddy was always a source of terror for her , and running away from home to someplace far away seemed like the answer .

She called up Arindam , calling in sick that day , even though she was in the pink of health . Arindam agreed without a second thought , Kavya was one of her most valuable assets , and giving her what she wanted once in a while wouldn’t hurt the company , and certainly not the productivity . She could do in an hour what would take most employees a good three .

There was anger in her , all stemming in from the fact that no one at office , home , the hostel or her friends appreciated her enough . “ I mean , wasn’t that was I was told from the beginning … good grades is the key to happiness . Get a minimum of ninety in every exam you ever write , and you’re automatically on the way to popularity . Everyone will say how cool you really are and there’s that . “ . But sadly , past her prime , Kavya realized this . Grades are what they are , letterings marked on a piece of laminated paper , not the key to happiness , or for that matter , success .

Already seven fifteen , Kavya was almost done deciding what she would be wearing . The jeans it was . After twenty minutes of messing around with the hair curler and concluding she was getting nowhere , she simply decided to leave it that way . Open , free , with a strand of those jet black tresses falling carelessly over her frameless glasses . A white tee with a bit of flowery print on it , some jewellery over her neck later , she was done . She was done , ready to find appreciation .

Kavya hailed an auto , the blistering morning cold of Delhi already getting on her nerves . “Hauz Khas chalogey bhayya ? “ . The driver nodded mutely , staring at her 32 D’s all the while . Twenty minutes of Delhi roads later , there she was , the orphanage .She’d brought along all the chocolates she’d got from the Russians , and some more . And toys for everyone . And she’d told Rambhai at the chat bhandar near her place to arrange hot chaat for all the kids .

There was another person , a certain  Varun Reddy , someone she met on the metro . She didn’t even know his last name , just that he told he’d be there that Sunday to help her out . And they’d met all because he liked she book she was reading on the metro .He gave a wide smile , not saying anything . He expressed gratitude for what she was doing , or maybe he was just checking her out , or maybe he was glad too that the kids had something to look forward to look to on that gloomy Sunday . Maybe his flared nostrills were indicating sexual interest , or maybe it was just that some pollen had gotten into his nose . His cheeks were flushed red . Maybe that was because he was happy to see her , or maybe the December cold was taking its toll on his Aryan skin . His breathing was shallow . Maybe that was because of his heart beating at an elevated rate , or maybe it was just his heart pumping in extra liquid to counter the excess chill that India’s capital was known for .Kavya didn’t care . Kavya didn’t care if Varun’s behaviour indicated if it was sexual interest or not . All she knew was Varun acknowledged her , he was happy to see her And she liked Varun too , though the inbuilt fear that came with the physical scars prevented her from teliing him so , maybe she would ….someday . Maybe she’d drop a hint today , maybe she’d give him that beautiful smile of hers . Maybe not , she didn’t know . . She was happy that she was finally doing something that mattered to her , something meaningful .

Twenty feet away , seven pani puris and a toblerone later , eight year old Raj was happy . He’d even got a power ranger model that he could play with , maybe even hold a display with all his other friends at the place where he called home . He wanted to tell thank you to the didi who had done this for him . Raj wanted to tell the words , but he couldn’t . The God people placed their trust in had been unkind to him . He didn’t care much for that fact .He didn’t care that he had no parents like the other kids whose parents used to buy their kid son papdi or a balloon from the vendor who used to shrill out really loudly on Hauz Khas road .  Atleast didi was nice to him . And that is what his tiny mind was able to understand and process . He didn’t know how to tell Kavya how happy he was . And then his mind understood a way to tell that he appreciated what didi did for home . He ran as fast as his stick like legs would propel him forwards , and gave Kavya didi a big , tight hug . A salty tear rolled down Kavya’s spectacle covered eyes . 

## How I met my she-wolf 

I’m usually the  pretty cynical types,looking for proof even when the evidence is right in front of me. Hell, I’d demand proof if God asked me to do Him a favor . But this is one of those instances where I am actually optimistic about this entire love business . The cynical compartment of the train that is mine is left behind at the station that is hope .It is my perception that love is overrated and glorified way too much , maybe because of things that I have seen around me . But still , maybe only a tiny bit , there is hope . Hope of a  future, however distant it may be , that I will be a happy man . That is  all we crave for anyways right , happiness , pure and simple ?

__________________________________________________________

So , the first time i saw her wasn’t exactly what you would called cinematic perfection of sorts . No magical feelings bubbling at the bottom of the stomach , no romantic music playing in the background . Totally normal setting .

She was giggling on one of those feminine jokes with her girl gang, y’know , one of those jokes which aren’t actually funny but you laugh along just to get along with the social convention. Not exactly a good time to say hello . She wasn’t one of those real hot chicks with the short skirts and tons of arrogance to throw around , more of the cute girl next door with the nice smile . More like the woman with whom you  could have a rational conversation with, someone who would talk nice to you , with that beauty of a smile never disappearing off of her high cheekbones .I guess it was the calm and composed demeanor that drew me towards her . But being the shy guy that I was ,it never even crossed my mind that I should go and introduce myself , heck , maybe even hit on her  . As it always happens in most of these stories , by a strange quirk of fate , we were made to sit next to each other in class .

There is a story about snake venom. A child is given snake venom in extremely small doses since he is a child . Then a snake bites him when he is in his teens . Nothing happens to him . The point I would like to convey here is that ….familiarity.You give me two months with Justin Beiber , and I might be able to tolerate him (her? ,it ?) . Fast forward a few years , and there wasn’t a day that went by before she made me break into a wide stupid smile with that infectious enthusiasm of hers.I loved her presence , just the fact that she was present in class made my day. And when she didn’t turn up for class , I used to sit around with darting eyes , expecting her to pop up into the class , her black eyes wide with excitement , braided hair swaying with the wind .

I always considered her as a friend , never crossed my mind to consider her as something more.I used to hate myself for thoughts like these crossing my mind. I used to think through it logically , listing all the dung I could fall into if the relationship we had went South . But as time progressed , so did the amount time we spent together . Which was an awful lot . I began to look at her as something more than a friend . I knew it was wrong , she was my best friend and its for the best that it should remain that way , but you cannot control biology now , can you ? .

We used to laugh at all our silly jokes and even the smallest of incidents used to  punctuate those giggles. I loved that smile . A genuine one . I liked the way it used to light up when she saw me . I liked the way her birthmark on her forehead used to bob above a few inches whenever she gave me a toothy grin . I liked the way her waist long braided hair swayed hypnotically when she sashayed away . I liked the sweet manner in which she used to reprimand me for even the tiniest mistake I made. I liked the petite wrists , and the black thread she wore around it for luck. I liked the fact that she was ten inches shorter than me . I liked the way she had to jump really high to give me a smack on the cheek . I liked ….her .

Nevertheless , on those rare occasions when I felt really lonely and alcohol took control of me , I used to wonder , “did she think of me as something more than a friend ? Was I someone she wouldn’t mind going out with ? ” . But as maybe years of experience can tell you , alcohol never gives you the answers , it only makes you forget the questions .

One cold December night , we were all alone at her place. I made a cup of coffee and some grilled bread to go along with it for both of us . Some old Hindi number was blaring softly in the distance .Staring at the distance while she babbled on about random things – how her lipstick was too runny , how her internet was slow and how beautiful Neal Caffries was . I wasn’t even listening to what she meant by what she said , I just wanted her to go on and on and never stop talking.I could just go on listening to that voice , a bass overtone , but the essential high pitched feminine portion of it still intact , giving her a husky tone that I was in love with . It didn’t seem like the appropriate thing to ask , nor the place . But I thought , no time like the present brother , ask her . I could tell you how romantic I was the first time I asked her out , those cheesy lines that American sitcom actors are so known for , but I said it out in simple words ” Hey , you want to go out with me ? ” .

She looked at me with those dark eyes , staring right into me , asking me thousands of questions without uttering a single word .I felt powerless , naked when she had that gaze on me . Almost like we had a connection that wasn’t exactly human , almost psychic . I knew her heart was fragile , she had been in love before . The guy didn’t like her , for reasons that fail to make sense even today . I had been to her place countless times during those days , consoling her and telling her that things would be okay . That she would find a better guy , a guy that would be understand her side of the argument and not dump her only because she refused to get physical so early . A guy that would love her for what she was , not the size of  her bra or the length of her skirt .

She leaned her head onto my shoulder , gazing into nothingness . One word was all she said , one word was all I needed for the endorphin to flow . Yes , she said simply . No promises extracted that I would guarantee not to get physical , no knee jerk reaction , just a simple word . Yes . That evening , we had our coffee , shared that toast and  spent the rest of the evening staring into the distant misty hills , not saying a word , perfectly content in each other’s company . We didn’t need to do anything to prove our trust to each other , I knew her well enough to know what was the first thing she did when she woke up on a Sunday morning .

Thank you for being there for me , she said . All I wanted to do was never to let that woman leave me , for with her , there was happiness . Not the kind that the airhead models on the television showcase , but happiness , clear and simple . I was not the example of emotional stability either , yes , there were issues in my life that I was not entirely happy about . But with her , all those I used to forget . With her in my life , all the negativity that was so prevalent in my life used to be forgotten , only used to look at the future with a sense of optimism that used to shock even me .

I left the next morning , and she gave me a warm hug to bade me goodbye . Although that was the usual routine whenever we bade goodbye , that particular time , it felt deliciously good for some reason .A few days later , she called me , asking me if I had thought about the date that I asked her for . No , I hadn’t . I only knew I wanted to be with her , but I knew I had to still woo her . That was how the process worked , right ? I was , and still am pretty clueless at that . But because having a calm demeanor was something of a natural talent , I calmly expressed my optimism . Then take me out , lets meet up , she said . Now i was getting panicky . Neither did I have a place in mind nor did i have an idea of what the perfect date would be like . I said I would pick her up in half an hour , but that laugh she gave at the end made me hurry .

I’m no good at fashion . My sense of fashion is decided by the “smell test” – smell a piece of clothing lying around . If it smells okay , wear it . If it does not , spray deodorant on it and wear it anyways . A face wash and some calming down later , I was on her front door at 4 in the evening , ready to whisk her away to nothingness on my bike . She was dressed pretty casually , nothing too gaudy or shiny to indicate that this was a date .Just a pair of ancient faded blue jeans and a white shirt with a slightly radical neckline. She gave me that smile of hers when she was about to sit behind me , and I melted away faster than ice cream in the microwave .

She held me tight while I drove the bike , and made involuntary chills run down my spine (okay , maybe that was December responsible for the chills) . I went towards the coast , I had a place in mind that she would love .  The shoreline , with a glorious view of the sunset . I knew she loved nature , that was one of the reasons why I loved her , nothing artificial , grounded and real . I stopped the bike at the place , and helped her get down . I shouldn’t have bothered , she was way too independent to let someone else help her . I got down , and we walked towards the shore , her hand in mine . We didn’t talk , the natural ambiance did all the talking . And why talk , when we knew we were happy in each other’s presence ? . We sat down on the cool sand , with only the sound of the waves for company . Silence , as we gazed into the deep waters that lay ahead of us .

They say that we are a superior race because we can communicate with our mouths . But on that evening , our eyes did all the talking . She asked me , what took you so long so come out ? I’ve loved you since a long time . I didn’t respond , just gave her a warm kiss on the forehead . She persisted , you’re the only person who knows me , and i hope , loves me with all my flaws . I knew I aint perfect , hell , maybe that is why the others I dated didn’t find me attractive . Shush , I told her . You’re perfect in my eyes . Don’t change . Just hold my hand .

The sun was a dimming orange ball of fire going down , and the moon was just making its presence known . I didn’t say a lot of words , just three of them strung together . I love you , I said .  She gave me her trademark heart breaking smile again , her eyes full of promise and gratitude . Thank you , I love you too , she wanted to say I guess . But we were people who didn’t say a lot . I leaned in , one hand behind her head , and gazed into her eyes , full of promise and hope for the future . A future where we would laugh , smile and stay happy , and even if we did fight , kiss and make up before cuddling together . With the orange sun for company and the rustling of the waves , she turned her head towards me . With one petite hand softly placed on my neck, she brought her lips dangerously close to mine.Her warm breath intoxicating like the wild poppies in the tropics . Sh leaned in , and our lips met for the first time  . There it was , my first love and I , happy , alone and in joy to be in each others company . Happy .

## What will the money do ? 

They say we are at the top of the chain on earth ...we rule over almost all the other species because of our apparent superiority . But in the process of doing so , we forget the purpose and manner of the survival of our race , the way it was intended to be , coÂ existentÂ . Crush the other species down , yes, the pleasure gained from it will be immense and the fruits , delicious ...but for how long ? When will we realize that when all the fish have been drawn out of the water , when all the rivers have run dry with caked toxic waste at the bottom , when all the trees have been Â cut to keep us warm during the cold winters , only then will we realize that the money that we printed in copious amounts and the virgin lands that we deflowered with our greed , are of no utility whatsoever . But as they say , there is no point in trying to extract the poison from the sweetened water . 

## Of copy machines in engineering colleges 

NOTE : None of this is factually accurate , so don’t get too excited . If you get easily offended over pointless things , I kindly request you not to issue a gag order against me .

In a developement that has left the entire college shocked , Sandeep paper traders has approached the college management with a salary package of 25 LPA . This developement has sent shockwaves across the campus ( excluding the GITAM institute for Gandhian studies , because that place is practically empty ) .

“ GITAM graduates end up working at TCS or go abroad to pursue their dreams . I commend Sandeep traders for this innovative initiative to stop brain drain “ , said Mr.Dasarp , a college representative .

Mr.Sandeep , the proprietor of the store , says “ I have to open the shop at 8 in the morning . Even then , these students come in and ask for graph sheets and things like that . As you can see , we are very busy at the moment “ , he said , even as ten students demanded things ranging from a 3 rupee pen to a 30 rupee notebook . ( We thank Mr.Sandeep for his valuable time . He talked to me for two entire minutes ) .

“Assignments , micro xeroxes, textbook photocopies, print outs , projects , lab results , question papers ….Many vacancies are there “, he says . “ One fellow who came to buy graph sheets was telling that engineering students are very good at copying assignments , so I thought , why not hire them “ , he says , even as he counts a fat stack of ten rupee notes by constantly licking his fingers .


Mr.Sandeep has been kind enough to  share with us some of the positions that are currently up for grabs , which include “ photocopier to customer paper passer” , “ Sub vice printing manager “ , “ chief problem assessment chairman” and “ micro xerox font analyzer” , to name a few .

A fourth year student claims that he rejected offers by TCS , Infosys and Google to apply for the prestigious job opening . “ I’ll stay in college and mint money like anything “ , he says , even as he learns how to resize the image in the photocopier .

GITAMites are already excited by the prospect of this wonderful opportunity , and have began preparation in earnest . Students have already started doing things to update their resume . We advise you start doing the same too.

Posting a bunch of pictures. No context. Found them nice. Don't know who the source is. All I'd like to say is thank you to whoever made these. :)
