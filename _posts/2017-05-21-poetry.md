## Anew 

So here I am ,

Battered and bruised

Lift me up and take me home

And I can’t seem to think straight

Take me home ,

Home .

___________________

You promised me , a life till eternity

Don’t leave me alone for the vultures to peck out my eyes,

Lift me up , I don’t wanna see that sight

I keep telling myself , I’ll be allright

This war is mine , all alone I fight

I tell myself , let the morning rays

Caress my eyes , I’ll be allright

I think of happy days to spend my sunny days ,

I’ll be allright

Everything I care about is vaporized

I’ll just close my eyes , I’ll be allright

Keep saying that

 

___________________

I’m just trying to get home ,

I’ll wager my soul , if there beholds a life full of laughter

As long as that life is not spent with you ,

I’ll take my Winnie pooh and snuggle myself to sleep

Yes , I’m not smiling , I have my reasons to weep

I should’ve started running , a long long time ago

Far away

___________________

I’ll do anything for you ,

Anything to see you content , that sfumato smile

Who am I kidding , we’re done

Over and out , fuck you

Yes , believe , close your eyes and fly away

Far , far away from me

Run

 

___________________

I’ve endured too much

I feel numb , no I’m not

I feel so used , so stepped on , so messed up

And people wonder why I wish to be alone

Like a blood thirsty ghoul , begging for blood

I crave to be a lone wolf , people will whisper

Like I care

But there is beauty in there , satisfaction

Show me where it hurts , and I’ll make it burn

Like hell on earth , until you scream no more

I’ll remember your cold dead eyes

That detached stare , that cruel mind

What I thought was trust

Stupid me


___________________

Someone wise said , there aint no mistakes

Only enlightenment , light dawning upon us

Yes , laugh away bastard , gimme all you got .

There is my perception , whilst I smile to myself , an imaginary congratulation

When all hope was gone , I found myself again

Reborn

So this is basically an account of someone who was forced to get into something they did not like (bad decision , apparently ). Enough is enough , they realize . And then , he/she gets out of it .

The basic point that I wish to convey is that even when walls seem to converge on you with an intensity that is baffling , push them away . You might cry , even regret it , for getting out of your shell and feeling the cold air on your skin ….but later , you’ll smile . Maybe a tad later , but when you realize you are free and under no one’s control , the realization that comes with it , priceless .


## "Utopia"

Every word controlled,

Every phrase scrutinized,

every sentence analyzed ,

by agents of the system, of which I am a part ,

well , technically , at least .

Namesake though , just for the records .

I’m scared to order my neurons to flow ,

to open that device of communication ,

it’s been stagnated for too long , far too long.

Inspiring love,hatred and murder all at once

all within an instant ,like those neon flashes.

Scared that it would inspire a tirade,

unleashed against me like Satan himself on earth .

Opinions hindered,ideas roadblocked by “agents of progress”

I laugh silently , progress , haha .

Fear casts its spell , all aboard the silent train .

We think all we want , but the words never flow ,

Like one sock out of two , pointless .

When the word spreads and rebellion ignites,

Don’t blame me , you’ve been adding powder kegs

dynamite and C4 , a heady mix waiting.

When “progress” gets wind of it ,

We’re clamped down , jailed and silenced.

Freedom , for me , is not the word as such

You can shut me up , kill me and skin me alive

But the idea of no man over you

Universal appeal , bitch .

Being controlled , puppet like , not my cuppa tea .

So when dissent is expressed

maybe in ways that Gandhi wouldn’t approve of

dear puppet master , don’t you trod me under or push me down .

Puppet master,your end is near.

A screaming death , your parting gift, for years of silence.

No second thoughts , put mercy aside .

Wake up and beg for mercy , smell the whiskey .

Press that snooze button , and you will wake up to a sight ,

the exact antithesis of your utopia .

I guess I’ve made the meaning I wanted to convey pretty clear throughout this effort of mine.Freedom , not in the sense of doves flying around and people hugging each other , but the idea of no man upon you. And yes , some lines in here are based upon the Arab spring revolution of last year …that was a major inspiration in penning this down .

I am proud of the fact that people are finally standing up to what is right , however small that change might be . I’m proud of you , not the facebook version of 1 like=1 salute proud , but really , standing up for what you trust in is something I have deep regard for . 

## The ballad of Gaea 

ou cut me , you hack me

you condemn me to death

progress is what you reason

with a silent face I bear this treason

 

 

You can kill me , smile while you murder for profit

But “superior” creatures, remember

I’m the reason , I’m the cause

That you wake up each morning

and take a whiff of that chilly November wind

 

 

You hit me , I’ll hit you back

and when I hit back, trust me , I’m accurate as a hawk

repercussions are far reaching , deadly

but you already knew that , yes ?

tsunamis,earthquakes droughts and floods in the middle of May

visual proof of the anthropocene

 

 

You destroy the vast greens I have ,

pollute the deep blues that as a gift I gave

smoke out the naked blue sky

make craters on my face to mine my treasure

I make my own foolproof rules ,

I’ll still survive , paranoid and I will not bow , never oblige ,

I’ll remember your cold dead eyes

the way your lifeless soul stared into mine

I’ve got all the experience that comes with time,

You , don’t . Tick tock , dependent .

## Victory 

As man’s instincts,
And machine’s lethal power
Continue to work hand in hand,
You can feel the cataclysm, hear the band.

As the rubber dodges the greens,
And handles sharp ones deftly,
As the sweat continues to pour,
Forgotten, unnoticed, uncared for.

A million hearts beat in anticipation
Of what’s to come.
The blur can now be seen,
The Victor leading with a scarlet cloak.

As the podium bears weight,
The demon drink is popped,
Ecstacy flows akin to blood.
Cometh the hour, Cometh the man.

My basic visualization for this was a combination of a formula one racer and that of a horse racer during the times of Rome’s excessive grandiose indulgence. I’ve tried to combine the richness of the history of rome with the speed that comes with formula one.

##  Come home , child 

They say you’re dead ,

burnt to ashes with the cinders ,

then scattered in the Ganges

Murdered away brutally , cruelly taken away

winged Archangels took you to a better place

That is the lie I’m told .

 

 

With but an anodyne tone , I tell them no .

They’re wrong , please tell me so .

I’ve been called mad , deemed a heretic .

But only I hear your song of despair

Reason alludes me , but I’m very sure

Your cry for help ,

that adagio , I hear its crystal clear tone .

 

 

I see your reflection in the clear pool outside

those dark blue pods staring right back into me

Saying “I’m sorry , it wasn’t in my hands”

Your soft , aeolian song leads me to you

begging me to forgive you

 

.

They took me away from you , I know

and now , the primal instincts tell me

to take you back , claim whats mine

Come,child , lets go home , I’ll be right by your side

even in death , I’ll still be by your side

You can’t reach me , its allright

I’ll just hang in there , I’ll hold on .

## What do you want 

Just another soul ,

up for grabs ,

mould me and sculpt me ,

into the desired , profitable shape .

I may hate the way I am ,

but to put food on the table ,

and to take that four wheeler for a spin

on a mundane monday morning ,

I need it , dependent .

Neurons have long been quantified ,

brainpower decided by a degree

*innovation* decided by how I sell myself

*success* decided by the bills I get

*happiness* decided by the size of the property I own

*pleasure* decided by the woman on my arm.

It aint a free world no more ,

yes , look at the outer eggshell , its all pristine white

but delve into the deep coagulated insides ,

and you’ll see , you’ll experience , you’ll know

this obsession with what others perceive

as signs of failure, success, defeat or happiness

Are we that uninspired a race

that we cannot decide what is true and what is false

that we’ve to be told what is acceptable and what is not ?

When will we not give a care ,

of what society will whisper at ?

of what elders with misguided morals will tell us ?

Jeez , are our brains that rotten ?

that I can’t live life my way , without being prodded and judged at every step

Do I have to live for the sake of others ?

Can’t I live for myself , y’know , selfish ?

It isn’t those well beaten and trodden upon paths ,

many chinks , not the perfect armour

But I know it , and maybe so do you

When you want something real bad ,

when you’re willing to travel lengths

the world might hate you for it

But you’re not concerned ,

at least you’re doing what you like , eh ?

I think this a segment of me , in a nutshell . Out .
